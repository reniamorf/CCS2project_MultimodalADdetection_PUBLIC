Important in what way? Like; monetarily?Well; I guess I went to the garden party in Buckingham Palace. That was neat. Yeah.Yes. Do you want me to tell what happened?Okay. I was working in London; England as a teacher. And in a very small school.And I don't know; but hook or by crook; I got this invitation to go to a Buckingham Palace garden party.With a whole pile of invitations; like; you know; if you drive by car; if you walk; there's passes for all these places to go into. So; it was a big bunch of stuff I got in the mail.And; well; I was super happy; of course. So; I went to my headmaster. And told him that. And he was super happy.And he just immediately told all the teachers; which were only like seven. And everyone except one were happy for me.And the other one just said; yeah; the foreigners get to do those things; but we don't. We're British. I'm the foreigner from Canada; right?So; but anyway; everybody was very happy. So; this guy who was nasty like that; he didn't talk to me for the rest of the year and a half I was there. He just; he was really angry. I don't know.I didn't do anything; right? Yeah. How did you get the invitation? So; I think it was through Canada House. Because when you go to England; for instance; to work or something; you should always register with Canada House.It was at Trafalgar Square; you know. And just; you know; to know that you're there. And if something happens to you; you know; they have a trace on you. Anyway; so that's what happened. So; I went.And it also said; well; if it rains; it's rained out and there is no second chance. So; it was; the garden party was in July. So; of course; thank goodness it didn't rain.And it was very; you know; strict about you had to wear a hat. You had to wear; this was 1963. I mean; hat; gloves; stockings; heels; like proper dress.Didn't matter; you know; if it was cold or warm. I mean; it had to be proper dress. And they were very strict about that. And so; we went there. And; you know; you go through the palace gates.You go through Buckingham Palace itself. You go down the steps. And then there's this huge garden with ponds and flamingos in the ponds. And they had three tents.Like; you know; like a wedding tent you would have. Three. One for the common mob; like me. One for the diplomats. And one for the royal family.So; and then there they were serving iced tea; iced coffee; and little biscuits and; I don't know; little sandwiches; whatever it was. So; and there were little tables set up and everything. Very; very nice.And then there were different bands playing in different places. Because the place is really quite big. I don't know if you've been; but it is quite big. Yeah. And so; at a certain time they said; okay.Now the royal party is coming. So; we all kind of got up. And there are walkways all along the garden there. So; we stood along the walkways.And there comes; you know; the queen; Philip; I don't know. So many other royals. I didn't know who they were at the time. And I didn't really care that much. But it was interesting.And; of course; that was the touch when the queen; the time when the queen never; ever shook hands with anyone. You know; there was no greeting or; you know; how are you.They just kind of walked nonchalantly past us all. Kind of smiling to the right and to the left. And then walked into their tent. Like they were kind of really bored.Because; you know; she does it three times a year. Two in London and one in Scotland. So; and then we went back to having our coffee and our little sandwiches and stuff.And little chit chat with whoever; you know. We happened to chit chat with. And I think by 4 o'clock; 4.30; they told us; you know; you started to leave. That was the end of it.So; but it was a really very nice afternoon. Happened to be fabulous weather. So; that was a big; big bonus. You know; and that was very nice. So; when I got back to school; then they; well; of course; I had to have the afternoon.Actually; the headmaster told me take the whole day off to get ready. You know; instead of just the afternoon. Well; next day I got back to school. And everybody was super happy and curious what happened.Everything except this guy who just didn't like it. So; it was; it was nice. It was a nice; it was a nice afternoon. Something to remember. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Definitely.And the Queen; of course; at that time was; you know; I'm talking now; 63. That's 50; 50 years ago; eh? You know; so she was a young woman.And I was; she was very spiffy. And; of course; he; I mean; she was.speak visa. So that was nice. That's very cool. That's very interesting. Okay; so the second question is; can you describe to me what you do on an average day? So for example; what you did yesterday?Oh; on an average day; well yesterday I had lunch guests from Britain. I have a lot of visitorsbecause I've been abroad so much myself and lived abroad in all kinds of places so I have a lot of outside contacts and; you know; because I go visiting; they come visiting of course.So yesterday I had friends from London who were here at my place for lunch. So in themorning I prepared lunch for them. They came at 12.30. We had lunch and talked about everything including why we're here. William; why Kate wasn't pregnant.They passed the one year mark. Well; exactly. And it's really crucial now; isn't it? So that was; you know; and of course Conrad Black and all. I mean; we talked about everything; you know; under the sun.Yeah; and then they left about five and then my nephew came over and we cleaned the garden. We just kind of cut down everything; you know.It wasn't blooming. So it was a lot of stuff to cut down and because it was such beautiful weather. So we sat in the garden; had a few drinks and until seven o'clock and then it got dark.And we saw a raccoon that came from my garage because the garage door was open. You know; we opened the garage door to get the tools out; the stuff; you know; the rake out.That's more or less my tools; my rake and my spade. Yeah; and then this old fat raccoon comes walking past. Oh; jeez. That was quite funny actually.They're so; they're so quiet and they're so evasive and they're so; you know; like you wonder what the heck was he going; you know? Yeah. Yeah.And they don't make any noise whatsoever. No noise. So that was my day yesterday and after that I washed the dishes; washed poop; washed some TV and that's it.That was it. That was my day. But every day is different. I don't have two days the same. That's good. Yeah. Absolutely.Oh; okay. It looks like the boy is playing in the garden; playing football.And I guess by mistake he kicks the ball and it goes through a window.And it goes through the window and lands through the window in the house and hits the lamp.And beside the lamp there's a guy sitting in his armchair. And the lamp; I think it falls.And it looks like; and the guy gets up and sees the broken window. Okay. Yeah; I don't know what happened to the lamp here. Okay.And what about the next photo? Oh; sorry; the next. The next page. Okay. The next page.So I guess it's time to maybe go to school in the morning. And the mother is giving the umbrella to her child.So the child says; well... Oh. I don't think the child gets the umbrella.Anyway; the third picture is the child; it's starting to rain. And now the kid has no umbrella. So now he's in; now he's getting wet. So he's; fourth picture he's running.Running back home; I guess. So he comes home all wet. The mother is angry. And mother gives; I guess; gives the kid the umbrella.So now the kid is on his way with the umbrella. Okay.And the last one.So what do we have here? Well; it looks like a; there's a tree; a man is in a tree.Or there's a cat on a branch. And I think the little girl wants the cat.And it's probably the... The father then went up the tree to try to rescue the cat.Meanwhile; the dog is barking up the tree; because of course the dogs chase cats.And meanwhile; now they're getting the fireman there; I guess; to come and rescue the cat off from the tree there. Or maybe rescue the father.I don't know. Okay. Great.Okay. Yeah; okay. So there's this girl; Cinderella.She lives in a household with three stepsisters and a nasty stepmother; and they're all nasty.And the invitation comes from the palace for these three girls to go meet the prince or something. And they get all dolled up.And of course; Cinderella has to stay home and do the dirty work. So they get to the... Okay. And they get to the ball. The three girls get to the ball; and everything's fine.Meanwhile; Cinderella is at home and doing hard work. And then the fairy godmother appears and said... Asks her if she wants to go; and yes.And the fairy godmother gives her a kiss. And then the princess goes to the palace. Gives her whatever. A beautiful gown and slippers and everything. And she's off to the ball in a pumpkin.And she says; you've got to be home by 12 o'clock. So she gets to the ball; and the prince is there having a fabulous time.And as it's 12 o'clock; Cinderella runs down the stairs of the palace; and one of her slippers falls off.And meanwhile; the princess; I think; had an eye on her. And she goes to the ball. But anyway; she rushes back to her pumpkin; because otherwise; I don't know what's going to happen. Anyway; she has to go. So she went.And then the prince says; well; you know; I want to find the girl who has this glass slipper. And so; the hunt goes out.So they all go out; and looking for the girl who fits... Whose foot fits the slipper. So they come to the house. And of course; the three sisters are there.They're super excited. They try on; but no; it didn't work. So anyway; then they... Then they say; well; there's Cinderella still there. You know; let her try it on.And then; of course; the slipper fits her. And the prince is happy; and they live happily ever after. I don't know.\",\n          \"I was running to my class at university to my finance class from my sociology class.Next thing I knew I woke up; looked at my wristwatch. It was still on; shock-proof by the way; it said 820 and the clock on the wall said 5 to 9.So I assumed something had happened. Yes; something had happened. I had two broken legs and I was in the hospital emergency.I remained there for three and a half months and was able to get out of bed and walk. And walking down the hall;I lost my balance on my crutches and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again.And then they took me back to bed with the wheelchair and I got into bed and the nurse came in andI said; am I going to the operating room? And she said yes. And I went to the operating room. I was put in a body cast from under myunderarms to the tip of my left toe. And I had to remain in that for another eight weeks. AndI finally got out of bed and learned to walk again; of course; because you can't walk when you're in bed forthat long. I came out of the hospital. My accident was October 12th. March 29th and that night I went to university to write a test.So and then I have to really learn to walk because I was on crutches at the time. And I learned to walk.And now I walk all over the city of Toronto and in Miami Beach all over Miami Beach. And while in the hospital;they would bring ambulatory patients to my room because they were depressed.Disregarding that except for going for x-rays. I was in this room at that point for four months.But I took the approach that there's nothing when you there's nothing you can do about something. Don't waste your energy. Move on and make the best of the situation.So the highlight of my day was watching Jeopardy!Well; you know; there's nothing. I'm not not to say I I walk around I have pain in my leg; but that's not gonna... it's gonna be there so I can't rule my life.I get up in the morning before 7; go to the corner; get the metro; and flip through it.The articles are short; but it tells you just as much as a major newspaper.On my way back from there; I stop at the Comshares; and we have a little talk; and the superintendent comes; and a couple of other residents come; and we talk for a little while.And then; I go upstairs; and I do; after I flip through the paper; I do the Sudoku and the crossword puzzle. And I usually get the whole puzzle.And then I will go and check the stock market on the internet; and my investments; and depending on...the day; I usually meet somebody either for lunch or dinner; but it depends on the day. And I belong to an investment club; so I kind of look if there's anything I think they shouldknow about; and whether I should be explaining; since I'm the accountant in the group; thatI should be explaining some kind of concept that they might not understand that's happening in the stock market.And then; if I went out for lunch; I will have dinner at home; or I will go over toa former neighbor who lives in a retirement home; and somebody gave her the jigsaw puzzlefrom hell; and she's not capable; she's 87; she can't do it. So I go over there; and my goal is to finish it before I leave for Florida in four months; so...whenever I have a night that I'm not doing anything; I'll go there.Okay; this boy is playing with his ball; and he kicks it; and it goes through the windowof somebody's house; and lands in the house; and the man finds the ball; and then comes...is now looking out the window to see who threw the ball through his window. Great. Okay.Looks like a little girl going out; and her mother holding an umbrella; but she doesn'tseem to want the umbrella; so she doesn't take it; and of course; it starts raining; and then she runs back. All wet. I think it's...Now; some look like a little girl; but I think it's a little boy; and runs back to get the umbrella; and then walks with the umbrella; after getting all wet anyways.Okay; there's a cat caught in the tree. The dog is trying to get to the cat.Looks like the father of the little girl is trying to get to the cat; but he can't; because the cat's all the way out on a branch; but guess what?To the rescue come the fire; come the man; and they have a ladder; and they're gonna... Obviously; it looks like they'll solve the problem.Cinderella lived in a house with her three stepsisters; and they treated her very mean. and she cleaned the house and they just gave her orders and told her what to doand they were all going to a ball and she wanted to go to the ball and her fairygodmother came and dressed her in a beautiful dress and she went to the balland then at the ball she was dancing withthe prince and she had to be back by midnight so she had to run out and whenshe ran out she lost her slipper and the prince was so enamoured with her that the next day he went all over the kingdom looking for the person and this was at the ball in full stopfit the slipper and he came to her house and of course her stepsisters said thatshe wasn't the one but he did try it on and fit her and they lived happily everafter.\",\n          \"Looking forward; I remember looking forward to going to summer camp when I was 13; 14 years old and knowing that I was going to be participating in a whole bunch of great activities. How's that?Great. What do you usually spend your day doing? Can you describe a typical day for you? Okay.Um; usually I will get up during the week; go to work; work for most of the day; come home; maybe have something to eat; maybe watch a movie; maybe go for a drink.Bless you; bless you.Okay. Um; boy kicking a ball; uh; the ball going through breaking a window; almost landing.Landing in the guy's lap and the guy looking out the window; look where it came from. And how about this one?The mother giving the child the umbrella; the child saying; no; I don't want it. It's starting to rain; the child's getting soaked; comes home; the mother's kind of furious that the kid didn't take the umbrella and the kid's not taking the umbrella.Great. Thank you. Um. And how about this one?Uh; a cat is stuck in the tree. Uh; looks like the guy used a ladder to go up and try to get the cat. The ladder fell and the guy's stuck up there and he looks like he's scared. And here come the firemen to rescue the guy and the cat.Yeah; yeah; yeah. Um. And the seven doors; yeah. Right? Uh; that's Snow White. That's Snow White. Cinderella; no; no; she and her stepsisters and stuff. Yeah. Yeah; yeah; I can tell it. Sure.Um; so if you could tell me the story; that'd be great. Yeah; well; she had; um; somehow she was living with her; uh; stepmother; right? I forgot how it happened.Her parents died or something and she was living with; um; her stepmother. Her aunt or something. Mm-hmm.Um; or; yeah; somehow she had stepsisters; though.Or her father remarried and died and her stepmother had three daughters or whatever and they were stepsisters anyway. She was made to be like the slave in the house.And; um; she; uh; somehow; uh; got to go to this ball. With these magic slippers.And she was; and; uh; she met a prince there and she was able to stay until midnight. Well; after midnight; everything; like; uh; she had no carriage anymore and no special dress.Everything went back to normal. Mm-hmm. And; but; uh; she went home and the prince was looking for her. Yeah; that's what I remember.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"classifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Important in what way? Like; monetarily?Well; I guess I went to the garden party in Buckingham Palace. That was neat. Yeah.Yes. Do you want me to tell what happened?Okay. I was working in London; England as a teacher. And in a very small school.And I don't know; but hook or by crook; I got this invitation to go to a Buckingham Palace garden party.With a whole pile of invitations; like; you know; if you drive by car; if you walk; there's passes for all these places to go into. So; it was a big bunch of stuff I got in the mail.And; well; I was super happy; of course. So; I went to my headmaster. And told him that. And he was super happy.And he just immediately told all the teachers; which were only like seven. And everyone except one were happy for me.And the other one just said; yeah; the foreigners get to do those things; but we don't. We're British. I'm the foreigner from Canada; right?So; but anyway; everybody was very happy. So; this guy who was nasty like that; he didn't talk to me for the rest of the year and a half I was there. He just; he was really angry. I don't know.I didn't do anything; right? Yeah. How did you get the invitation? So; I think it was through Canada House. Because when you go to England; for instance; to work or something; you should always register with Canada House.It was at Trafalgar Square; you know. And just; you know; to know that you're there. And if something happens to you; you know; they have a trace on you. Anyway; so that's what happened. So; I went.And it also said; well; if it rains; it's rained out and there is no second chance. So; it was; the garden party was in July. So; of course; thank goodness it didn't rain.And it was very; you know; strict about you had to wear a hat. You had to wear; this was 1963. I mean; hat; gloves; stockings; heels; like proper dress.Didn't matter; you know; if it was cold or warm. I mean; it had to be proper dress. And they were very strict about that. And so; we went there. And; you know; you go through the palace gates.You go through Buckingham Palace itself. You go down the steps. And then there's this huge garden with ponds and flamingos in the ponds. And they had three tents.Like; you know; like a wedding tent you would have. Three. One for the common mob; like me. One for the diplomats. And one for the royal family.So; and then there they were serving iced tea; iced coffee; and little biscuits and; I don't know; little sandwiches; whatever it was. So; and there were little tables set up and everything. Very; very nice.And then there were different bands playing in different places. Because the place is really quite big. I don't know if you've been; but it is quite big. Yeah. And so; at a certain time they said; okay.Now the royal party is coming. So; we all kind of got up. And there are walkways all along the garden there. So; we stood along the walkways.And there comes; you know; the queen; Philip; I don't know. So many other royals. I didn't know who they were at the time. And I didn't really care that much. But it was interesting.And; of course; that was the touch when the queen; the time when the queen never; ever shook hands with anyone. You know; there was no greeting or; you know; how are you.They just kind of walked nonchalantly past us all. Kind of smiling to the right and to the left. And then walked into their tent. Like they were kind of really bored.Because; you know; she does it three times a year. Two in London and one in Scotland. So; and then we went back to having our coffee and our little sandwiches and stuff.And little chit chat with whoever; you know. We happened to chit chat with. And I think by 4 o'clock; 4.30; they told us; you know; you started to leave. That was the end of it.So; but it was a really very nice afternoon. Happened to be fabulous weather. So; that was a big; big bonus. You know; and that was very nice. So; when I got back to school; then they; well; of course; I had to have the afternoon.Actually; the headmaster told me take the whole day off to get ready. You know; instead of just the afternoon. Well; next day I got back to school. And everybody was super happy and curious what happened.Everything except this guy who just didn't like it. So; it was; it was nice. It was a nice; it was a nice afternoon. Something to remember. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Definitely.And the Queen; of course; at that time was; you know; I'm talking now; 63. That's 50; 50 years ago; eh? You know; so she was a young woman.And I was; she was very spiffy. And; of course; he; I mean; she was.speak visa. So that was nice. That's very cool. That's very interesting. Okay; so the second question is; can you describe to me what you do on an average day? So for example; what you did yesterday?Oh; on an average day; well yesterday I had lunch guests from Britain. I have a lot of visitorsbecause I've been abroad so much myself and lived abroad in all kinds of places so I have a lot of outside contacts and; you know; because I go visiting; they come visiting of course.So yesterday I had friends from London who were here at my place for lunch. So in themorning I prepared lunch for them. They came at 12.30. We had lunch and talked about everything including why we're here. William; why Kate wasn't pregnant.They passed the one year mark. Well; exactly. And it's really crucial now; isn't it? So that was; you know; and of course Conrad Black and all. I mean; we talked about everything; you know; under the sun.Yeah; and then they left about five and then my nephew came over and we cleaned the garden. We just kind of cut down everything; you know.It wasn't blooming. So it was a lot of stuff to cut down and because it was such beautiful weather. So we sat in the garden; had a few drinks and until seven o'clock and then it got dark.And we saw a raccoon that came from my garage because the garage door was open. You know; we opened the garage door to get the tools out; the stuff; you know; the rake out.That's more or less my tools; my rake and my spade. Yeah; and then this old fat raccoon comes walking past. Oh; jeez. That was quite funny actually.They're so; they're so quiet and they're so evasive and they're so; you know; like you wonder what the heck was he going; you know? Yeah. Yeah.And they don't make any noise whatsoever. No noise. So that was my day yesterday and after that I washed the dishes; washed poop; washed some TV and that's it.That was it. That was my day. But every day is different. I don't have two days the same. That's good. Yeah. Absolutely.Oh; okay. It looks like the boy is playing in the garden; playing football.And I guess by mistake he kicks the ball and it goes through a window.And it goes through the window and lands through the window in the house and hits the lamp.And beside the lamp there's a guy sitting in his armchair. And the lamp; I think it falls.And it looks like; and the guy gets up and sees the broken window. Okay. Yeah; I don't know what happened to the lamp here. Okay.And what about the next photo? Oh; sorry; the next. The next page. Okay. The next page.So I guess it's time to maybe go to school in the morning. And the mother is giving the umbrella to her child.So the child says; well... Oh. I don't think the child gets the umbrella.Anyway; the third picture is the child; it's starting to rain. And now the kid has no umbrella. So now he's in; now he's getting wet. So he's; fourth picture he's running.Running back home; I guess. So he comes home all wet. The mother is angry. And mother gives; I guess; gives the kid the umbrella.So now the kid is on his way with the umbrella. Okay.And the last one.So what do we have here? Well; it looks like a; there's a tree; a man is in a tree.Or there's a cat on a branch. And I think the little girl wants the cat.And it's probably the... The father then went up the tree to try to rescue the cat.Meanwhile; the dog is barking up the tree; because of course the dogs chase cats.And meanwhile; now they're getting the fireman there; I guess; to come and rescue the cat off from the tree there. Or maybe rescue the father.I don't know. Okay. Great.Okay. Yeah; okay. So there's this girl; Cinderella.She lives in a household with three stepsisters and a nasty stepmother; and they're all nasty.And the invitation comes from the palace for these three girls to go meet the prince or something. And they get all dolled up.And of course; Cinderella has to stay home and do the dirty work. So they get to the... Okay. And they get to the ball. The three girls get to the ball; and everything's fine.Meanwhile; Cinderella is at home and doing hard work. And then the fairy godmother appears and said... Asks her if she wants to go; and yes.And the fairy godmother gives her a kiss. And then the princess goes to the palace. Gives her whatever. A beautiful gown and slippers and everything. And she's off to the ball in a pumpkin.And she says; you've got to be home by 12 o'clock. So she gets to the ball; and the prince is there having a fabulous time.And as it's 12 o'clock; Cinderella runs down the stairs of the palace; and one of her slippers falls off.And meanwhile; the princess; I think; had an eye on her. And she goes to the ball. But anyway; she rushes back to her pumpkin; because otherwise; I don't know what's going to happen. Anyway; she has to go. So she went.And then the prince says; well; you know; I want to find the girl who has this glass slipper. And so; the hunt goes out.So they all go out; and looking for the girl who fits... Whose foot fits the slipper. So they come to the house. And of course; the three sisters are there.They're super excited. They try on; but no; it didn't work. So anyway; then they... Then they say; well; there's Cinderella still there. You know; let her try it on.And then; of course; the slipper fits her. And the prince is happy; and they live happily ever after. I don't know.\",\n          \"I was running to my class at university to my finance class from my sociology class.Next thing I knew I woke up; looked at my wristwatch. It was still on; shock-proof by the way; it said 820 and the clock on the wall said 5 to 9.So I assumed something had happened. Yes; something had happened. I had two broken legs and I was in the hospital emergency.I remained there for three and a half months and was able to get out of bed and walk. And walking down the hall;I lost my balance on my crutches and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again.And then they took me back to bed with the wheelchair and I got into bed and the nurse came in andI said; am I going to the operating room? And she said yes. And I went to the operating room. I was put in a body cast from under myunderarms to the tip of my left toe. And I had to remain in that for another eight weeks. AndI finally got out of bed and learned to walk again; of course; because you can't walk when you're in bed forthat long. I came out of the hospital. My accident was October 12th. March 29th and that night I went to university to write a test.So and then I have to really learn to walk because I was on crutches at the time. And I learned to walk.And now I walk all over the city of Toronto and in Miami Beach all over Miami Beach. And while in the hospital;they would bring ambulatory patients to my room because they were depressed.Disregarding that except for going for x-rays. I was in this room at that point for four months.But I took the approach that there's nothing when you there's nothing you can do about something. Don't waste your energy. Move on and make the best of the situation.So the highlight of my day was watching Jeopardy!Well; you know; there's nothing. I'm not not to say I I walk around I have pain in my leg; but that's not gonna... it's gonna be there so I can't rule my life.I get up in the morning before 7; go to the corner; get the metro; and flip through it.The articles are short; but it tells you just as much as a major newspaper.On my way back from there; I stop at the Comshares; and we have a little talk; and the superintendent comes; and a couple of other residents come; and we talk for a little while.And then; I go upstairs; and I do; after I flip through the paper; I do the Sudoku and the crossword puzzle. And I usually get the whole puzzle.And then I will go and check the stock market on the internet; and my investments; and depending on...the day; I usually meet somebody either for lunch or dinner; but it depends on the day. And I belong to an investment club; so I kind of look if there's anything I think they shouldknow about; and whether I should be explaining; since I'm the accountant in the group; thatI should be explaining some kind of concept that they might not understand that's happening in the stock market.And then; if I went out for lunch; I will have dinner at home; or I will go over toa former neighbor who lives in a retirement home; and somebody gave her the jigsaw puzzlefrom hell; and she's not capable; she's 87; she can't do it. So I go over there; and my goal is to finish it before I leave for Florida in four months; so...whenever I have a night that I'm not doing anything; I'll go there.Okay; this boy is playing with his ball; and he kicks it; and it goes through the windowof somebody's house; and lands in the house; and the man finds the ball; and then comes...is now looking out the window to see who threw the ball through his window. Great. Okay.Looks like a little girl going out; and her mother holding an umbrella; but she doesn'tseem to want the umbrella; so she doesn't take it; and of course; it starts raining; and then she runs back. All wet. I think it's...Now; some look like a little girl; but I think it's a little boy; and runs back to get the umbrella; and then walks with the umbrella; after getting all wet anyways.Okay; there's a cat caught in the tree. The dog is trying to get to the cat.Looks like the father of the little girl is trying to get to the cat; but he can't; because the cat's all the way out on a branch; but guess what?To the rescue come the fire; come the man; and they have a ladder; and they're gonna... Obviously; it looks like they'll solve the problem.Cinderella lived in a house with her three stepsisters; and they treated her very mean. and she cleaned the house and they just gave her orders and told her what to doand they were all going to a ball and she wanted to go to the ball and her fairygodmother came and dressed her in a beautiful dress and she went to the balland then at the ball she was dancing withthe prince and she had to be back by midnight so she had to run out and whenshe ran out she lost her slipper and the prince was so enamoured with her that the next day he went all over the kingdom looking for the person and this was at the ball in full stopfit the slipper and he came to her house and of course her stepsisters said thatshe wasn't the one but he did try it on and fit her and they lived happily everafter.\",\n          \"Looking forward; I remember looking forward to going to summer camp when I was 13; 14 years old and knowing that I was going to be participating in a whole bunch of great activities. How's that?Great. What do you usually spend your day doing? Can you describe a typical day for you? Okay.Um; usually I will get up during the week; go to work; work for most of the day; come home; maybe have something to eat; maybe watch a movie; maybe go for a drink.Bless you; bless you.Okay. Um; boy kicking a ball; uh; the ball going through breaking a window; almost landing.Landing in the guy's lap and the guy looking out the window; look where it came from. And how about this one?The mother giving the child the umbrella; the child saying; no; I don't want it. It's starting to rain; the child's getting soaked; comes home; the mother's kind of furious that the kid didn't take the umbrella and the kid's not taking the umbrella.Great. Thank you. Um. And how about this one?Uh; a cat is stuck in the tree. Uh; looks like the guy used a ladder to go up and try to get the cat. The ladder fell and the guy's stuck up there and he looks like he's scared. And here come the firemen to rescue the guy and the cat.Yeah; yeah; yeah. Um. And the seven doors; yeah. Right? Uh; that's Snow White. That's Snow White. Cinderella; no; no; she and her stepsisters and stuff. Yeah. Yeah; yeah; I can tell it. Sure.Um; so if you could tell me the story; that'd be great. Yeah; well; she had; um; somehow she was living with her; uh; stepmother; right? I forgot how it happened.Her parents died or something and she was living with; um; her stepmother. Her aunt or something. Mm-hmm.Um; or; yeah; somehow she had stepsisters; though.Or her father remarried and died and her stepmother had three daughters or whatever and they were stepsisters anyway. She was made to be like the slave in the house.And; um; she; uh; somehow; uh; got to go to this ball. With these magic slippers.And she was; and; uh; she met a prince there and she was able to stay until midnight. Well; after midnight; everything; like; uh; she had no carriage anymore and no special dress.Everything went back to normal. Mm-hmm. And; but; uh; she went home and the prince was looking for her. Yeah; that's what I remember.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"classifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"repeated_word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 93,\n        \"min\": 11,\n        \"max\": 478,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 25,\n        \"samples\": [\n          140,\n          478\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mistakes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 19,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          17\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"vocabulary_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 129,\n        \"min\": 115,\n        \"max\": 584,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          525,\n          365\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lexical_diversity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.6113353282812918,\n        \"min\": 1.967479674796748,\n        \"max\": 4.476027397260274,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 30,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.380952380952381,\n          3.0602739726027397\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"float32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 28,\n        \"samples\": [\n          12.381525039672852,\n          12.659077644348145\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
