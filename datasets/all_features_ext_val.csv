10;Baycrest10306a_plain.txt;"A specific event or?I did a canoe trip in 1998; 21 days; paddling on the Mackenzie River in the Northwest Territoriesto do a historical reenactment of the trip to the Klondike that was used by the prospectors trying to get there.And that was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience. I was with; initially; five people. Two of them dropped out partway through the trip.They didn't consider it safe. But it was a fascinating trip to see that part of the world.And we paddled; in one case; past two days of forest fires on one bank of the river. And the smoke; we had to put claws over our mouths to be able to breathe properly. The smoke was quite heavy.The paddling itself was a little bit different. The paddling itself was not particularly onerous because the current is very strong in the Mackenzie River. But we did paddle a lot. We paddled nine or ten hours a day to keep going.We averaged about 72 kilometers a day on the paddling. We covered almost 1;400 kilometers on the whole trip.And surprisingly enough; although we were on a river; drinking water was one of our biggest problems. Because the Mackenzie River is a very silty river; you can't see a half inch into the water.So we had to find side streams that were clear in order to get fresh water to be able to drink. It was.A typical day; I get up fairly early in the morning about 6 o'clock.I either go into the office to work there or I work from home by dialing in on my computer.I work on designing a database or solving problems around the design of a database.And I work right through until 5 or 6 o'clock; depending on the requirements of the project. I take a break for lunch. And that's pretty much my work day.I come home or am at home and have supper with my wife. And spend the evening doing different things. Sometimes just watching television.Sometimes going out for a walk. Sometimes visiting with friends. Sometimes I'm going out to lodge meetings.The story is a boy was playing soccer. He kicked the soccer ball and it went through the window of the house and broke the windowand landed in the living room; knocked over a lamp. And the man was sitting in the chair next to the lamp and he picked up the soccer ball and looked out the window to see where it had come from.And how about this one? A woman was giving her child an umbrella. The child was saying they didn't need the umbrella and left it with their mother.And then went outside and it began to rain. And the child ran home and was all wet. And mother was angry at him for getting wet.And he went back outside after he'd got dry clothes. And with the umbrella that he should have had in the first place.Ah. A cat went up in a tree. And a man went up to retrieve the cat using a ladder. The ladder has fallen down and the...So the man had trouble getting out. A dog was barking up the tree for no particular reason that I can see. And the fireman had been called to rescue. And now both the cat and the man.Excellent. Perfect. For this next task;Oh my goodness. My granddaughter will never forgive me if I didn't.Cinderella lived with her aunt. So Aunt Pitch had three stepsisters. And they always gave her the dirty jobs to do around the house.And then she met a good fairy who; oh sorry.And the wicked; the nasty stepsisters were invited to a ball in the castle.And they got dressed up to go. And Cinderella was there. She just wanted to stay at home and not go to the ball.The good fairy came and waved her magic wand and gave Cinderella a wonderful dress.And slippers; glass slippers to wear to the ball.And then she went to the ball where she captured the interest of the prince who danced with her. And fell in love with her.but the problem was Cinderella had to leave at midnight because the coach that she came in; which the Good Fairy had created from a pumpkin and mice; would change back into a pumpkin andCinderella would be back in her old clothes at midnight as well. So she ran out; but as she ran;she lost one of the slippers; one of the good class slippers; which the prince recovered. Then he went searching throughout his kingdom to try and find the girl or the woman who hadmatched the slipper and he came to the house where Cinderella was with her stepsisters andthe stepsisters; their feet were too big and would not fit into the shoe and Cinderella was allowedto try the shoe and it fit and she went off to marry the prince and live happily ever after.";0;92;0;367;2.444141689373297;12.577943;Baycrest10306a_egemaps.csv;23.6;0.235;19.6;22.1;27.8;8.17;254.0;328.0;95.2;181.0;1.31;0.456;0.743;1.19;1.8;1.06;13.8;8.94;8.42;6.06;1.4;0.583;31.0;0.314;7.85;1.06;8.24;1.46;5.04;2.17;0.0617;1.75;1.5;0.703;1.17;4.29;5.03;2.05;26.3;0.363;503.0;0.368;1350.0;0.155;-76.4;-1.15;1470.0;0.161;1100.0;0.254;-83.8;-0.973;2450.0;0.131;990.0;0.322;-88.4;-0.886;-17.4;-0.306;28.4;0.253;-0.0256;-1.09;-0.0221;-0.533;1.69;0.496;35.2;0.222;7.85;1.15;8.76;1.53;4.5;2.73;-13.3;23.0;-0.0502;-0.0126;0.877;2.59;1.6;0.255;0.301;0.144;0.177;-19.9;0
11;Baycrest10347a_plain.txt;"When I was three years old; I have a very vivid memory of being left with my sister and having our; a young woman who was taking care of us at home while my mother worked at the office with my dad at his store.And it was the summer of 1946; and my sister and I were playing and this young gal wanted me to go have a nap in the afternoon in the summer. Day nap.And I was protesting and I was so upset; I went into the bedroom; waited a few minutes and snuck out of the house and then walked on my own dumps through the downtown to my dad's store.I did.Well; you know; Winnipeg was a smaller city and it was different in 1946 and I knew the way. Being in the car; kids; they'd pick it up fast. Yeah.So yes; you ask for a memory; there it is.Okay; yesterday I was at home in the morning because we were entertaining some people that were coming over for brunch.We had some; some of my children came over and my grandchildren were over; two or three of my grandchildren were over and then we had some guests that used to live in Winnipeg.So that was for part of the day till about two o'clock. I then walked my grandson of two and a half years of age from my place to Bathurst in Eglinton actually.It was quite a walk for him. And he did it all and then I stayed a little with my sisters and my daughters and then from there I visited one of my sons.And then we came home and basically I watched the show.I took my wife to a Zumba class at Baycrest Village and then we watched the Grey; I watched the Grey Cup. That was my day.In these pictures? Well the first one is this kid kicks the ball and it looks like it breaks a window; goes through the window and there's a guy sitting there.And the man that's sitting there picks up the ball and was looking out the window in the broken pane. What about this one?Woman seems to have an umbrella and she's looking to give it to her daughter. The daughter takes it. I don't know if she takes it. We can't tell that. It starts to rain.Doesn't look like the daughter takes it actually. So up in paragraph three it's raining. Kid's getting wet. Very wet. Kid comes home.Looks like all wet. Mother's not happy. And then the kid takes the umbrella and goes out in the umbrella when it's raining again.Well there's a man stuck in a tree and the dog is barking and the girl's trying to get the cat off the tree.A little tricycle there and there's a ladder. No one comes to fireman I guess to help him get down from the tree.What do you want me to tell you?Cinderella; a young girl who lived with a stepmother and two stepsisters who tormented her.She did all the work around the house very badly and life was pretty harsh for her.So one day an invitation comes sent by the royalty that there's going to be a big ball. The prince is going to be there.And they're very excited. They're going to wear and they're excited. They want to go to great occasions.But Cinderella wants to go but they're just a nothing.So they all look dressed up and go to the ball one night. And Cinderella's left behind.Fairy godmother. Magic wand. And she basically turns all her rags into wonderful clothes.And she makes a coach out of a pumpkin. And horses suddenly submerged.And she's whisked away to the ball. And she's given a warning. But before she sets foot out of the coach she says; You know; fairy godmother told you you have to be home by midnight.Or everything's going to turn back to what it was. Lo and behold; she goes to the ball. The prince has danced with all the women at the ball. But nothing struck his fancy.But then he sees Cinderella. And after that it's happiness for all of them. They're just having a great time. And she suddenly realizes it's close to midnight. And she rushes down the stairs.Leaves a slipper behind or one of her shoes behind. And she gets into the chariot and heads home. But she's lost her shoe.And she's back to where she was. And everybody comes. There she is; working away still.And then there's an announcement that the prince is trying to find somebody that matches the shoe. And he still has the shoe. And he wants to find the match.Anyways; he goes around from home to home in all the kingdom. And to the home where Cinderella lives. And tries it on the stepsisters.Nobody else is there. And sure enough he pretends she's not there. But ultimately she's gone.And she gets a crack at it. And tries it on. And it's a perfect fit. And there it is. Council summary.

12;Baycrest10599a_plain.txt;"I have to think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk about it for eight. It was important to me to get into law school.That was something that happened that was very important. I have no idea why I was accepted; because I don't think I met any of their criteria;except I probably filled the quota for mature students; so that they could show that they had a diverse program. How old were you when you applied? 32.I was 32 when I started; so I guess I was 31 when I applied. And in my year; the median age was 22.So I was one of the oldest in the class. I had nothing in common with anybody else in my class. I mean; they still remembered high school.Who thought about high school? And they all knew each other from high school; and they were there because they didn't get into medical school;or because their parents wanted them to be there; or because their parents were lawyers. And I was just flummoxed. I was just sitting in this room listening.And I was listening to these people who came; with no commitment whatsoever; no caring about the issues; or the institution.They were just there because; well; I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the circumstances. And I was there because I just really cared.And so I really didn't fit in. Really. It was at the end of the first year when I made my first real friend.Up until then; I was friendly with people; but I didn't understand the limits of that friendliness; and it was very limited.Because we were told to get into study groups; and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what they wanted. Like; they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious.Why would anybody say the obvious? So people said the obvious; and they were rewarded. So those were the people sought after to be in the study groups; not me.So I did almost everything alone for the entire year. And when I asked to borrow one of my friend's notes; she said she had to get permission from her group.Because they couldn't share notes outside the group. So I said; thanks; but no thanks; don't bother. And somewhere along the line; I found a group that really didn't give a shit.And just anybody who wanted to could be there. And I was part of it. That was me. So I was part of that group for some classes. At the end of the year; in the subway station; I met someone who I'm still friends with; who I just adore.But we had been divided into two groups of 50 or 75 people. And she was in the other group; so I never saw her.And in second year; things improved a bit; because then I think I made a second friend. And that was good. Like once I had a couple of friends to talk to; and especially one or two in the year ahead.So that was a bit better. As an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the students; who all thought they were special;we had one class in second year with a teacher who was really a decent person.And he said; please; when you write your exams; don't think that your mark is a reflection of your quality as a human being. And I thought; wow.It is so amazing to hear something like that. And I said that to someone in my class; who completely disparaged this teacher because he wasn't bright.It was in law school that I learned that competent was a derogatory word. Oh; he's a competent lawyer. And that the positive term was bright. If you weren't bright; you were nobody.So; because he wasn't bright; the students didn't respect him. And I made the mistake of saying to someone; you know; yeah; okay; but he's decent.Like he's a decent person. He has a heart. And she said; a heart? I didn't come to her class. I came to a class of Oz; where this one doesn't have a brain and this one doesn't have a heart. I came to law school. I didn't talk to her again.What university did she go to? U of T. U of T was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada. I don't know why.And I also didn't understand that law schools had their own kind of bent. And that U of T was law and economics. I didn't know that either.But I didn't know that. I didn't even get it until after I left. So; really; it wasn't the right school for me. I really should have gone to York. That's good.But when I came to Toronto; people were saying; oh; U of T; it's the best school. And why would you want to be way out at York? You're in Toronto. You want to be downtown. So I thought; okay; I want to be downtown.So I was downtown. Okay. And lastly; I'd just like you to look at these and tell me what's going on.Boy kicks the ball; flies into a glass window; breaks the window; and falls into the living room of the man. It knocks over the lamp.The man stands up; holding the ball; looking out the window to see who threw it; presumably. Yeah; it looks like he's got a gun in his pocket. He doesn't have a gun.Okay. And the child doesn't want one. Oh; but in this; in the second one; the child does want the umbrella.Nope. If you look at the whole series of cartoons. Well; oh; oh; oh; oh; oh; I see. So the mother offers the child the umbrella. The child refuses. The child says goodbye.Goes outside. It's raining. It's really raining. And the kid runs home; soaking wet.Goes to the mother; who's not pleased; and gives him an umbrella so that he can walk in the rain where it's pelting. And lastly; if you can just say; describe what's happening in this picture.Well; what's happening is that firefighters are rushing; it looks like; to save a man from a tree.But it looks like what happened is that the little girl's cat was chased up the tree by the dog. The man climbed up the tree to save the cat. And then he got stuck.And then the firemen are coming to save the man. Maybe the cat was chasing the bird. No; I think the dog was chasing the cat. Mind if I make it a 20-minute? Sure.The bane of feminists everywhere.Cinderella's story about a beautiful young woman who lived with her horrible stepmother and her two ugly stepsisters.And I don't think we find out how she got to that situation; but clearly her father did not marry well. And the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a slave.She always; she had to do all the cleaning and all the cooking and all the washing and take care of them. And didn't get treated nicely; and she didn't get to go shopping for new clothes; and she wasn't given the best food to eat.And anyway; she was just treated horribly. One day; the stepmother and the stepsisters; the two stepsisters get an invitation from the palace to come to a ball.Cinderella; thinking she's a member of the family; thinks she can go along; but she can't. So she has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get ready for the ball; and then they go.After they leave; she's very disappointed because she really wanted to go to the ball. And somehow or another; her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she can go to the ball; but she has to be home by midnight.So she gives her beautiful dress to wear; lovely new shoes; and turns a pumpkin into a carriage; turns the mice into horsemen and horses;and the only rule is be back by twelve. So Cinderella went to the ball. She had a wonderful time. Nobody knew who she was. Everybody was saying; oh; who's that woman; who's that woman? The prince danced with her the whole evening. She had a lovely time.And then as the clock was striking twelve; she realized she had to leave. So she ran out. In running out; she lost one of her shoes; which was a glass slipper;made it to the carriage; and got home just as the carriage turned into a pumpkin. Following that; the prince found the missing slipper;and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper. So he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on women's feet to see if it fit. It didn't fit anybody.Finally; he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly stepsisters. And he tried it on their feet. It didn't fit any of them. And he saw Cinderella and said; why don't you try it?Or possibly she said; why don't I try it? And he tried it on; and it fit. And he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after having danced with her for a few hours.And she; of course; being swept off her feet; agreed to marry him; not understanding what it would mean that she'd just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and cooking. But the book doesn't take you that far.";0;160;0;493;3.7545638945233266;12.39996;Baycrest10599a_egemaps.csv;32.2;0.19;31.2;33.0;35.4;4.2;300.0;450.0;122.0;224.0;0.458;0.622;0.2;0.394;0.667;0.466;6.76;5.0;3.73;2.98;0.257;0.864;34.0;0.309;4.91;2.5;10.5;1.2;-2.9;-4.19;0.034;1.73;1.31;0.68;6.38;0.527;9.28;1.28;29.6;0.354;641.0;0.255;1490.0;0.142;-136.0;-0.633;1600.0;0.146;1210.0;0.257;-138.0;-0.581;2530.0;0.104;1060.0;0.352;-140.0;-0.548;-18.9;-0.364;29.9;0.277;0.013;1.84;-0.0224;-0.599;0.365;0.649;38.9;0.209;4.95;2.83;12.3;1.16;-7.5;-1.8;-15.2;25.6;-0.00945;-0.0108;0.198;2.16;1.32;0.126;0.12;0.27;0.376;-25.1;0
13;Baycrest10631a_plain.txt;"So you mean I know the answer?Maybe we'll go with our marriage.We didn't want to have a church ceremony; so we founded JP. This is in San Diego; California.We founded JP; but he was way the heck and gone east of San Diego.So we drove out to this little tinky tiny town called Boulevard and had a ceremony with JP and then drove all the way back.And then a few months later; we learned that there was actually another JP in town about two miles away. But it was still interesting. Not too many people know where Boulevard is in San Diego.These days; I'm the cleaner of the house and washer of the dishes. I'm also one of the players with the cats; so we do that. I watch way too much television.I spend a lot of time on my computer. I'm working on a project. And reading books. I read a lot of books.So; kick the football through the window. All right.So; kids out on the field. Kids out on the field. The guy's kicking the ball around by himself; apparently; wearing a hat; almost properly. And he evidently; we will assume; kicks it through the window.The man inside the window knocks over a lamp; breaking the window and probably breaking the lamp.And the guy stands up with the ball in his hand and looks out the window. And I guess he's going to get prepared to yell at the kid. Excellent. And how about this one?The kid goes off to school. Mama says; take your umbrella. The kid says; nah. The kid's not walking to school. The kid's rained on. He says; oops. So; he turns around to go back.She's mad because she offered him; but then she gives him the umbrella after all. And he goes to school somewhat wet with an umbrella. Great. And this one; last one. How did you learn?I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. A cat managed to get up a tree and now can't come down as cats are rumored to do; but I'vehad plenty of cats come down from trees; and I don't know what that's all about. The cat might have been after a bird singing in a tree.So a guy tried to help by climbing up the tree; the dog was barking at the guy; and someone had the presence of mind to call the fire department who were bringing their ladder up to rescue at least the cat; if not the guy.Great. So somebody must have called the police. Perfect. You know less than half of all fire calls are not for fires; but things like that. It's appalling. That's true.Well; bearing in mind that what I know is only the Disney version. That's cool. And not the Santa Cruz.That's the only version I know; too. Yeah. Um. So; um. So; um. Um. So; is it better for me to just say what I think it is? Yeah; sure. Um.I guess that's the one.Yeah; that's the one with the three sisters and a problematic stepmother and the sisters;two of the sisters were all vain and uppity and the one that made Cinderella do all the work in the house. And they got invited to a ball; fancy ball.And they spent a bunch of money getting ready for the ball and they went and left her behind. But I don't remember how she got her.Who gave her the magic stuff?Invitation.Okay; I don't remember any of this of how she got her dress. I imagine young girls would remember all of that part of it. Um.So; she somehow got her hands on a dress and ended up in the castle; um; taken by magic. Um.And she had a pumpkin carriage and she had to leave at the Stoke of Midnight. So she wowed everybody at the party and made her sisters jealous.In fact; I think they didn't even recognize who she was. And then when the clock started ringing; she ran away even though the prince said; oh; I don't know.And she ran away and left behind a slipper because it fell off of her foot; a glass slipper; I don't know what it was. And leaped into her carriage. And just as she got home; I turned back into the house.So the prince tried desperately to find the girl that he; the shoe was unusually small; luckily.Finally the person whose foot fits this. And so he had his luckies go all over the kingdom; fitting it on everyone's foot. And they finally found her.And he ended up marrying her. I can't remember what happens with; you know; the princess. The stepmother and the two girls.I think she doesn't treat them badly. I think she treats them shockingly well. And she leaves that to later after. Is that approximately right? Yes.The magic comes from a fairy godmother. Oh; right. Okay. Yeah; this is the one with the fairy godmother.";0;66;0;358;2.7374301675977653;12.438868;Baycrest10631a_egemaps.csv;22.7;0.329;14.7;24.8;28.9;14.2;223.0;307.0;81.1;98.8;1.03;0.54;0.495;0.926;1.48;0.989;11.0;8.52;6.73;5.57;1.24;0.789;34.9;0.287;12.2;0.82;8.39;1.52;8.16;1.32;0.0799;1.71;1.45;0.672;1.22;5.79;4.03;4.61;27.1;0.53;576.0;0.361;1430.0;0.141;-30.9;-1.54;1540.0;0.163;1160.0;0.246;-41.2;-1.06;2610.0;0.148;1010.0;0.351;-49.1;-0.852;-21.3;-0.367;34.1;0.286;-0.0328;-1.09;-0.0197;-0.528;1.29;0.769;36.0;0.259;12.8;0.775;8.96;1.44;8.3;1.33;-11.6;21.8;-0.0379;-0.0121;0.669;2.04;1.54;0.588;0.923;0.0569;0.0565;-16.5;0
14;Baycrest10668a_plain.txt;"Well; I guess one of the happier events was getting married for the second time. The first time ended.It ended; and not as a surprise to me; or a shock to me.And so meeting somebody and getting married for the second time and having a real buddy and a pal; as well as somebody I love to get along with and have a good time as a senior;that's an important event in my life; and a happy event in my life.I start off with reading the newspaper at about 7.30; 8 o'clock in the morning. And I have different activities.I'm pretty involved with curling; and I curl at least two times a week in the mornings with a senior's group.And sometimes; not so much anymore; but it was at one time competitive curling.And competitively; and that's one of the things that occupies a lot of my time in the wintertime. I'm also on the board of our condominium corporation; and I'm treasurer of that;so I'm responsible for a considerable amount of money. We have probably a million and a half to a million and three quarters dollars in our reserve fund that needs to be managed.And my board meetings are about once a month. But there's also activities that are weekly.And summertime; we do a little bit of traveling; a little bit of traveling in the wintertime; too. And a little bit of golf in the summertime.And that takes up most of my day; watching sports and television in the evening; particularly hockey; baseball.The little boy is playing with a soccer ball; and he kicks the soccer ball;which goes through a plate glass window right into the living room and almost onto the lap of a man sitting inside who holds the balland perhaps threatens not to return the ball. Great. Okay. Okay. What about...He's a little boy who is about to go to school; and his mother hands him an umbrella because it's probably going to rain. He doesn't want the umbrella.He's giving it back to his mother. He gets out and he discovers that it is raining. He comes home soaking wet.He's learned his lesson; and this time he goes and uses the umbrella to keep dry. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Just this last story here.The kids have been out playing in the park; and a dog has chased the boy up into the tree.Oh; the boy went up into the tree to try to rescue the cat. Doesn't look like the dog really chased the man up into the tree; but he's barking at him.And to rescue the cat; the firemen have come; and they brought their ladder; and they're going to climb the tree and rescue the cat for the little girl. Well; obviously; I'm going to use the book.Surrender. Cinderella. I have a handsome prince.Cinderella had an unpleasant aunt who tried to rule her lifeand made Cinderella do all kinds of tasks and jobs around the house.And Cinderella met the handsome prince;and she was doing all these unpleasant tasks that her stepmother asked her to do;more unpleasant tasks. There was a ball; and Cinderella got herself dressed in her finest dress to go to a ball.And at the ball; she met the handsome prince. And had a great time.Her stepmother; or fairy godmother; was very jealous.And Cinderella had to return home at midnight.And after having an evening in dancing with the handsome prince; and came home; and...Oh yeah; somewhere she lost her shoe at the dance and the handsome prince came and foundthat the shoe fit Cinderella and they lived happily ever after.";0;82;0;286;2.409090909090909;12.748525;Baycrest10668a_egemaps.csv;21.9;0.301;14.9;23.3;27.2;12.3;176.0;241.0;78.2;104.0;1.16;0.652;0.408;1.03;1.82;1.41;15.2;9.91;9.48;7.07;1.42;0.927;33.0;0.408;13.7;0.801;10.2;1.18;1.34;9.06;0.0763;1.68;1.52;0.684;0.787;7.23;4.99;4.01;28.9;0.512;540.0;0.336;1370.0;0.154;-29.5;-1.87;1530.0;0.174;1130.0;0.282;-43.0;-1.16;2580.0;0.134;959.0;0.379;-49.6;-0.965;-21.2;-0.355;31.9;0.278;-0.00202;-20.4;-0.0263;-0.547;1.5;0.894;34.8;0.357;14.7;0.706;10.9;1.12;1.02;12.3;-8.96;18.0;-0.0298;-0.00964;0.712;2.29;1.37;0.651;1.09;0.0833;0.0957;-17.1;0
15;Baycrest11257a_plain.txt;"I was running to my class at university to my finance class from my sociology class.Next thing I knew I woke up; looked at my wristwatch. It was still on; shock-proof by the way; it said 820 and the clock on the wall said 5 to 9.So I assumed something had happened. Yes; something had happened. I had two broken legs and I was in the hospital emergency.I remained there for three and a half months and was able to get out of bed and walk. And walking down the hall;I lost my balance on my crutches and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again.And then they took me back to bed with the wheelchair and I got into bed and the nurse came in andI said; am I going to the operating room? And she said yes. And I went to the operating room. I was put in a body cast from under myunderarms to the tip of my left toe. And I had to remain in that for another eight weeks. AndI finally got out of bed and learned to walk again; of course; because you can't walk when you're in bed forthat long. I came out of the hospital. My accident was October 12th. March 29th and that night I went to university to write a test.So and then I have to really learn to walk because I was on crutches at the time. And I learned to walk.And now I walk all over the city of Toronto and in Miami Beach all over Miami Beach. And while in the hospital;they would bring ambulatory patients to my room because they were depressed.Disregarding that except for going for x-rays. I was in this room at that point for four months.But I took the approach that there's nothing when you there's nothing you can do about something. Don't waste your energy. Move on and make the best of the situation.So the highlight of my day was watching Jeopardy!Well; you know; there's nothing. I'm not not to say I I walk around I have pain in my leg; but that's not gonna... it's gonna be there so I can't rule my life.I get up in the morning before 7; go to the corner; get the metro; and flip through it.The articles are short; but it tells you just as much as a major newspaper.On my way back from there; I stop at the Comshares; and we have a little talk; and the superintendent comes; and a couple of other residents come; and we talk for a little while.And then; I go upstairs; and I do; after I flip through the paper; I do the Sudoku and the crossword puzzle. And I usually get the whole puzzle.And then I will go and check the stock market on the internet; and my investments; and depending on...the day; I usually meet somebody either for lunch or dinner; but it depends on the day. And I belong to an investment club; so I kind of look if there's anything I think they shouldknow about; and whether I should be explaining; since I'm the accountant in the group; thatI should be explaining some kind of concept that they might not understand that's happening in the stock market.And then; if I went out for lunch; I will have dinner at home; or I will go over toa former neighbor who lives in a retirement home; and somebody gave her the jigsaw puzzlefrom hell; and she's not capable; she's 87; she can't do it. So I go over there; and my goal is to finish it before I leave for Florida in four months; so...whenever I have a night that I'm not doing anything; I'll go there.Okay; this boy is playing with his ball; and he kicks it; and it goes through the windowof somebody's house; and lands in the house; and the man finds the ball; and then comes...is now looking out the window to see who threw the ball through his window. Great. Okay.Looks like a little girl going out; and her mother holding an umbrella; but she doesn'tseem to want the umbrella; so she doesn't take it; and of course; it starts raining; and then she runs back. All wet.

16;Baycrest1144a_plain.txt;"I was running to my class at university to my finance class from my sociology class.Next thing I knew I woke up; looked at my wristwatch. It was still on; shock-proof by the way; it said 820 and the clock on the wall said 5 to 9.Yes; something had happened. I had two broken legs and I was in the hospital emergency.I remained there for three and a half months and was able to get out of bed and walk. And walking down the hall;I lost my balance on my crutches and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again.And then they took me back to bed with the wheelchair and I got into bed and the nurse came in andI said; am I going to the operating room? And she said yes. And I went to the operating room. I was put in a body cast from under myunderarms to the tip of my left toe. And I had to remain in that for another eight weeksAnd I finally got out of bed and learned to walk again. Of course cuz you can't walk when you're in bed forthat long. I came out of the hospital my accident was October 12. came out of the hospital March 29th and that night I went to university to writea test so and then I have to really learn to walk because I was on crutchesat the time and I learned to walk and now I walk all over the city of Torontoand in Miami Beach all over Miami Beach and while in the hospital they wouldbring ambulatory patients to my room because they were depressed disregardingthat except for going for x-rays I was in this room at that point for four months but I took the approach that there's nothing when you there'snothing you can do about something. Don't waste your energy. Move on and make the best of the situation. So the highlight of my day was watching Jeopardy.Yeah. I'm glad that worked out; actually; in the end. Well; you know; there's nothing; I'm not; not to say; I walk around; I have pain inmy leg; but that's not gonna; it's gonna be there; so I can't rule my life.I get up in the morning before seven; go to the corner; get in the metro; and flip throughit. The articles are short; but it tells you just as much as a major newspaper. On my wayback from there; I stop at the; the Com Shares; and we have; you know; we have; you know; we have a little talk; and the superintendent comes; and a couple of other residents come;and we talk for a little while. And then I go upstairs; and I do; after I read; flipthrough the paper; I do the Sudoku and the crossword puzzle. And I usually get the wholepuzzle. And then I will go and check the stock market on the internet; and my investments; and; you know.And depending on the day; I usually meet somebody either for lunch or dinner; but it dependson the day. And I belong to an investment club; so I kind of look if there's anythingI think they should know about; and whether I should be explaining; since I'm the accountantin the group; that I should be explaining some kind of concept that they might not understand that's happening in the stock market.And then if I went out for lunch; I will have dinner at home; or I will go over toa former neighbor who lives in a retirement home; and somebody gave her the crossword;the jigsaw puzzle from hell; and she's not capable; she's 87; she can't do it. So I goover there; and my goal is to finish it before I leave for Florida in four months; so whenever I have a night that I'm not doing anything; I'll go there.Okay; this boy is playing with his ball; and he kicks it; and it goes through the windowof somebody's house; and lands in the house; and the man finds the ball; and then comesout; and is now looking out the window to see who threw the ball through his window. Great.Okay; looks like a little girl going out; and her mother holding an umbrella; but shedoesn't seem to want the umbrella; so she doesn't take it; and of course it starts raining; and then she runs back. Okay. All wet.I think it's now; some look like a little girl; but I think it's a little boy; and runs back to get the umbrella; and then walks with the umbrella; after getting all wet anyways.Okay; there's a cat caught in the tree. The dog is trying to get to the cat.Looks like the father of the little girl is trying to get to the cat; but he can't; because the cat's all the way out on a branch; but guess what; to the rescue come the fire; comethe man; and they have a ladder; and they're going to; obviously; it looks like they'll solve the problem.Cinderella lived in a house with her three stepsisters; and they treated her very meanly.And she cleaned the house; and they just gave her orders; and told her what to do; and they were all going to a ball; and she wanted to go to the ball.And her fairy godmother came; and dressed her in a beautiful dress; and she went to the ball.And then at the ball; she was dancing with the princess.And she had to be back by midnight; so she had to run out; and when she ran out; she lost her slipper.And the prince was so enamored with her that the next day; he went all over the kingdom; looking for the person who fit the slipper.And he came to her house; and of course; her stepsisters sit.

17;Baycrest11752a_plain.txt;"Okay. Well; one of the very important things that happened to me in my life is my transition from one country; another country; moving to Canada. That was a very positive experience.And I was a teenager at the time. And Yeah.And it was a significant change. It was quite a drastic change. But it was interesting in the sense that it was just moving from one country to another. It was just a big change and a big transition. And it was; you know; with all these expectations and all these challenges; learning; you know; getting used to a whole new culture; not language; because I spoke English; where I came from; right; where our language was English.And but just getting used to a whole new culture.And; you know; ways of doing things and also in the manner of speaking. You know; we spoke differently from how we speak here.And so just getting used to everyone and the culture and the system. It wasn't; well; one of the things when I started to drive was driving on the right-hand side here. We drove on the left in Guyana. It's former British Guyana.Right.And; you know; just getting used to consumerism. That was one of the big shock. You know; we didn't spend money there like we did here. Like my parents certainly didn't spend money and buy clothing and shoes and take the many vacations like people do here. It was just a big culture shock. And there was just money that was; money that's so dispensable.Right. Right. It's just a dispensable commodity. And I guess it's just like everything else today; especially in the last 15; 20 years; you know.It's like everything has become dispensable. You know; it's like you buy a shirt; you wear it a few times; and then you can go get another one because it's so inexpensive now. Yeah.There's no premium on anything anymore. But there's a premium on education; and that's where I invested my time. And I spent many years in education while working and studying. I just did it because I felt I could do it. And it was immensely challenging; but I struggled through it; and I was very successful.A typical day; a work day; I'll describe a typical work day. I'm up at 5 a.m. I just got used to getting up really early. And I would have a cup of coffee; and I would brush my teeth and shave and shower.And then I would put on my sweatpants and t-shirt; and if it's the wintertime; I'd get on my jacket and winter shoes; and I would go around the block for a walk; a couple of tours.I would do it two; three times; especially when it's colder. You kind of have to cut the walks short. And so; by the time I'm done; I'll go out and come back in and go out and come back in; sometimes go out again and come back in.By then; I'm sweating. So; that gives my; it revs up my whole system; and that's great because it just jumpstarts my whole body. And then I'll just undress and cool down and then get dressed and go to work.And I don't typically have a morning breakfast. It's just something I got used to; and it works really well for me. But I drink really good coffee and put brown sugar. I don't consume dairy products because I'm lactose intolerant.And so; I'll walk to work. It's about a 12-minute walk; 12 to 15-minute walk; depending on the weather. And then when I get there; I'll have another half a cup of coffee. Well; maybe almost a full cup; but with brown sugar again.And then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative tasks to get done; and you check your email and voicemail and all these other things that are not chargeable time in the firm. So; administration consumes a lot of time.And by then; it's 8 o'clock. Then I'm ready to get into my work. Like; for another half an hour; I'm ready to get into my; you know; the charge of the work. Right.Whether it's auditing or accounting or tax work; whatever is; whatever I have on my desk or whatever.Whatever I have assigned to me. And so; that will take up; consume most of my morning. I tend not to eat or snack during the day. I'm a little bit disciplined with that because I used to; and I used to be very; and it didn't work well for me.I was very overweight at one time; and it didn't work well for me. So; I; and then I sit down all day. Right.And so; that's; that became a problem because I was developing lower back problems. So; I really had to get rid of the weight. And it changed; it made a huge change. Right. So; I'm actually a pure; pure vegan now. Right.And for the last three years; well; a total of five years now; but mostly; so the last three years. And so; lunchtime will come around; and I take my lunch. So; I make my own lunch. And so; I'll have lunch between 11.30 and 12.30 or so. I actually go out for a walk.Right. I always get up and go for a walk; get some fresh air; and come back in and have lunch. Not a long walk; but a short walk. And then I'll have lunch. And by 12.30; between 12.30 and 1 o'clock; I'm ready to get back into my work. Right.So; I'm also the technical guy in the firm. And then around 1 o'clock; then I really get back into my; the chargeable work. And so; one to three; so I give it a solid two hours; one to three; and then I take a break at 3 o'clock to 3.15. And I just get some water or go downstairs and go for a walk; a short walk.Right. And any other issues that come up again; the same thing. Administrative stuff goes on all the time. For sure.And then between 3.15 to 5 o'clock; I'm into chargeable work. And then I try to get out of there right after 5 o'clock. So; I pack up at 5 o'clock and do the routine stuff; check your email and respond or whatever. It can be personal stuff. It could be client-related matters. And then I try to get out of there right at 5 o'clock or shortly after.Because I come in early in the morning. I work at 7 o'clock in the morning. And I make sure I'm there at that time every day. That's a typical work day. Sounds great. Monday to Friday. Cool. Sounds good.All right. This next task is somewhat similar. I'm going to give you some pictures that sort of look like a comic strip. And what I'd like you to do is tell me the story that the pictures tell.Tell me.So; he's kicking a soccer ball. And the soccer ball broke the window. And the soccer ball went through the glass pane; broke the glass pane and went through the window into someone's living room.And he's gotten up. The fellow who was sitting at someone's house; it looks like; has entered someone's house through the broken window. And he's now gotten up and he's picked up the ball and he's looking out to see who did that.Great. So; starting at 1. Mm-hmm.Okay. So; the mother is giving her child the umbrella because it looks like it may or may not rain. And so; he's; okay. So; he didn't; he just said goodbye and he did not take the umbrella. But then when he went out; it started to rain. So; he; I guess he regretted not taking the umbrella. So; he became wet. He walked through the rain and he became wet and he went back home.And it looks like he went back home and he got the umbrella. After all. Right.And this story is; it looks like the pet; the child's pet is up in the tree and the father is trying to get the pet. And it looks like he's stuck in the tree now as well.And the dog is barking up the tree; but they call the fire department and so the fire; the ambulance; the fire guys have gotten their ladder and they're going to go rescue the pet. And maybe the father. I thought. Great.Step sisters; right? And the wicked witch. Yeah; basically. Yeah.So; this is the knight. I guess this is the picture of her knight in shining armor. I'm not sure who the girl and what the significance of the girl and the dog is.And this is the wicked witch and the three step sisters. And this is Cinderella. More like the housemaid or the house servant.And these were her friends. The birds were her friends. So; she confided in the birds; I think. She would seek comfort in her pets. Some of the pages are taped together.Okay. And; yeah. So; they sort of just; she was the house servant or the housemaid; right? And so; the three step sisters.They just ordered her around or bossed her around and that sort of thing. So; they were horrible to her. And; yeah. So; there you go.She serves them when she was their maid; essentially. And the knight; I guess that's a picture. That's the grand house that they lived in. The picture of the knight.And so; there you go again. She was always; she was their cleaner and housemaid. And; oh; this is the delivery of the invitation.They were going to a ball; right? So; that's the invitation being delivered.And; okay; there's the stepmother who was reading the invitation. They were going to the ball at the king's palace or something like that.And; I guess; this is probably Cinderella inquiring whether she was; invited or not. And this is the wicked witch telling her that she wasn't.Or she wasn't going to show it to her or something like that. And; okay; so there's Cinderella getting her dress ready for the ball.Looking; is that the; is that the; I'm not sure what that is; but that's probably this.Somebody looking at pictures of a dress. Yeah. That's the; whether it's Cinderella or the stepsisters.And this is; okay; so this is the; the; the; the little animal is creating a dress for Cinderella.And this is Cinderella looking out the; her house or where she lived at the castle where the ball was going to be held.And; and the; the pets are; are happy that; they're happy for something.going to the ball or something like that because this is the dress and the and anecklace and here she is she's she's got the dress she's trying to dress I guessin a superficial way she's not trying it on but she's looking at herself in it with it that's the mirror behind her and this is the okay this okay so these arethe oh they cut up her dress okay so the wicked sisters the three step sistersand the wicked stepmother destroyed her dress and they were heading off to theball okay so there she is she's just in despair because I guess she wasn't invited to go to the ball or they destroyed her dress and she wasconfiding in who is that I'm not sure what that is that's the fairy I guess the fairy godmotherand okay so the fairy godmother is has come to her rescue I guess I take it andokay so the fairy godmother is well she's still that's the dress that wasdestroyed this is gonna be that the carriage that's gonna take her to theball okay the fairy godmother and okay and that's Cinderella there and that's her carriage looks likeokay and that's Cinderella all dressed up to go to the the ball in her carriage that she's arriving at the castle that's the castle okay and that'sCinderella arrived at the castle and this is the king and his confidant Iguess I take it and that's Cinderella there with the prince okay and that's the glass slippershe lost her glass slipper it was midnight or something like thatwhere is that that's the carriage leaving the palace okay and that's her returning home without her glass slipper without one of the glass slippers that'sthe the stepmother is that the stepmother it looks like that's Cinderella at home with the stepmother and that's one over there okay so that'sthere they're trying to fit the glass slipper on one of the stepsisters so that's and okay so that's the king who brought our okay so that's one of the king's men I guesswho brought the glass slipper and it fitted Cinderella correctly or properly so it belonged to her okay so there she gets her prince in the end I've actually never readCinderella I just know it from watching cartoons and just having a general understanding of but I know there were Disney books and movies and DVDs and all this otherstuff I've actually never watched it I guess a girl would more watch Cinderella than I would maybe yeah it's a fun story I guess it is a fun story it was the fairy tale of the time for young girls I think definitely";0;478;0;584;4.476027397260274;12.861627;Baycrest11752a_egemaps.csv;23.5;0.272;16.0;25.0;28.4;12.4;211.0;264.0;128.0;159.0;1.34;0.519;0.642;1.24;1.93;1.29;15.1;10.3;8.25;5.46;1.5;0.704;35.9;0.314;10.9;0.973;0.823;13.7;1.59;7.24;0.0866;1.64;1.5;0.658;0.972;5.65;4.97;2.94;28.2;0.396;543.0;0.35;1390.0;0.141;-30.9;-1.92;1480.0;0.164;1180.0;0.258;-41.6;-1.31;2480.0;0.166;1000.0;0.367;-50.2;-1.03;-18.1;-0.32;31.4;0.241;0.00556;6.24;-0.0254;-0.479;1.59;0.665;37.5;0.272;11.2;0.93;1.08;10.8;1.26;9.41;-11.0;21.1;-0.02;-0.0136;0.781;2.43;0.907;0.545;0.787;0.0616;0.0641;-18.5;0
18;Baycrest11841a_plain.txt;"Well; it was when I was a kid and I went with a group of my friends. I think it was maybe about eight or between eight and ten; something like that. We went down to this local creek.We lived in a small village; and it was about a mile down to the creek; and it was springtime. And we were cautioned not to go down because it was; you know; the river; the creek was high.Not a river; it was a creek. Well; anyhow; boys will be boys; and we defied all odds; and we went down. And we always had; like; hammers and nails that we'd borne from our father's workshops.So we went down; and we found some logs. And some odd boards; and we put together a raft. And we went rafting; and the water was very free-flowing; and it was fantastic.But; of course; we hit one point; and there was an ice flow; and the raft went sideways; and we all went into the water.So; you know; and at that time; we wore rubber boots; but they were no help because the water was more; like; waist-deep. And we got soaked from the waist down. Water went in the boots.And then we finally... We finally made it to shore; thank goodness; otherwise; it could have been more serious.And when we got to shore; we emptied our rubber boots; but we still had our socks on; and we were wet. And it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in the spring.And we had to walk the whole mile home on a gravel road. And it was like slosh; slosh; slish; slosh; you know. And it was getting colder because when you're wet like that.And we got home; and; you know; unfortunately; our parents saw us first. Coming in the door; where have you been? What happened? We got a huge reprimand; you know. Yeah; for sure.But thankfully; we made it home. But because the temperature was dropping; our sort of jeans; or at that time; whatever we were wearing;I remember they were starting to become more like cardboard; you know. They were starting to freeze. So it was like walking along like a robot.But we made it home; and everything was fine. But it was saddening that we got reprimanded; but we were happy when we were doing; you know; the activity itself. So we had a good time.And; you know; we laughed about it. And; you know; we were all chummy; and we walked back. We didn't think too much of it. But; you know; when we got home; it was kind of sad. For sure. All right.A typical day; I would go for a walk.I would go shopping. I would try to get involved in some local activity. We have community gardens. We have a recreation center on site where I live.So there are a variety of activities. If it's a very hot day; I would choose to maybe go downtown to Yonge-Dundas Square; Harborfront. You know; sometimes it's kind of neat to pretend.You're a tourist; you know; and the tourists seem to be very polite; you know. Up in my neck of the woods where I live right now; you say hi to somebody; and they look at you kind of strange. Like; what do you want?Whereas the tourists seem to be friendlier. So I'll go to Harborfront. If I've got the funds; available funds; I'll go to the islands. That's time-consuming.But during the week; it's the best time to go. On weekends; you have to stand in line; and it's a little more time-consuming. You spend more time.You travel downtown and going across in the ferry and coming back than sometimes you do on the island. And it's a great place to walk because there are no vehicles there. And; you know; there's bicycle rentals; canoe rentals.There's lots to do; miles of walkways. So; yeah; I try to keep busy. I try to immerse myself in a variety of activities.Otherwise; I find; you know; doing the same thing; it's like being a security guard. You have to go and guard the same post and stand there all day. You know; see the same people traversing back and forth.So it's kind of nice to try different activities. I like the; you know; variety. For sure. Sounds great. Yeah.There's no Cinderella in these. There's no Cinderella in these ones. Okay.Looks like the boy's kicking what appears to be a soccer ball. And unfortunately; it goes; breaks the window; a shuttered window with the shutters open.And in number three; the ball comes in a room with a man sitting in an armchair.The man picks up the ball; looks out the window; glances it through the broken window; holding the soccer ball. Perfect. How about this one?Can I just scan the whole? Okay. See the progression?Looks like probably the mother is speaking to the little boy; trying to hand him an umbrella. He says; no; no; no; no. I don't want the umbrella. It's not going to rain.And upon leaving for school with his backpack; it appears that the rain had commenced.And then he looks like he's on his way home; or way back; with his backpack; wearing his head; and stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down;arrives home totally soaked; facing the mother; and she doesn't look too happy.And he probably got a reprimand and was told to go out again; try again; this time with an umbrella; not to wherever he was going; probably school.How about this one? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.Looks like there's a girl who's reaching up into a deciduous tree trying to catch her cat.There's a tricycle; perhaps the little girl was driving the tricycle.There's a man up in a tree; in a ladder perhaps; he was climbing up the tree and now there's a dog barking up the tree at the man.He looks very perturbed; upset because he can't get down off the tree. Meanwhile firefighters arrive in their truck; two firefighters are running with a ladderto probably an attempt to rescue the man. And there's a bird chirping on another branch.Okay; it's a fairy tale about Cinderella. And it's about Cinderella and a prince.Cinderella lived with her mean stepmother who had two other daughters that were nottoo fond of Cinderella and always were happy when she was getting into trouble. And she was very happy. She was made to do all the work.Cinderella was a very kind and gentle person and she lived; I believe; in the attic. And she would talk to the birds.She was always working; but she would think of; you know; how she was made fun of by the other two sisters.She would just lazy around; lounge around and laugh at her. She was over at work.She'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the two mean sisters.There was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse.Cinderella was always mopping; mopping; cleaning; you know; cooking; doing all the things; scrubbing; on the floor with her hands and knees.Cinderella received a delivery. It was sealed. And the delivery went to the stepmother.The stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody read it out to the sisters and to Cinderella. Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited.But as it turned out; she was not. So the stepmother denied her that.And I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the ball. They were invited to a ball. The prince was having a ball.Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the ball. In fact; she tried on her look-to-do dress that she would like to wear. She was going to the ball.She imagined the dress and then she looked at pictures of the dress.She was friends with all the small creatures. They decided to make a dress for her.So they sewed and they spun and they weaved and; you know; appliquéd the bows on the dress. She didn't know this was happening.She glanced at the castle and probably heard the music.The birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special surprise for her. She was so delighted with the dress.Meanwhile; the stepmother and the two sisters were prancing off to the ball and Cinderella was left back.She was very forlorn and depressed with her dress in shreds. I believe that they may have been responsible.She cried. Everybody was sad. Her friends; the animals; the small creatures.The fairy godmother heard her pleas and her sorrow.And she came and waved her magic wand and turned the pumpkin into a...It's a sad story. It is.Into a magnificent coach for Cinderella.Then she was off in the coach with the blessing of the fairy godmother.She arrived at the ball and was greeted at the door. Back to the prince's assistance.There she met the prince that the fairy godmother had. Bryce told her at the stroke of midnight she was to be home.In her haste; when she heard the clock dong; dong; dong;she ran off. And behind she left her glass slipper.Meanwhile; she raced home before the entire dream had disappeared in the coach.Because the coach was then turned back to a pumpkin at midnight. She made it back. The dress disappeared.The angry godmother met her. And she was very annoyed at her that she came home so late.Meanwhile; the prince sent his attendants to find the girl to whom the slipper belonged. They tried.They tried it on so many different ladies' feet that were at the ball. It wouldn't fit. However; they finally came up.Upon Cinderella; it fit. They brought her back to the castle.";0;150;0;552;3.4655797101449277;13.027687;Baycrest11841a_egemaps.csv;22.1;0.268;15.6;23.6;25.7;10.1;256.0;312.0;126.0;174.0;1.09;0.48;0.587;0.991;1.52;0.931;11.6;9.3;6.4;5.19;1.08;0.753;29.6;0.362;12.4;0.698;4.27;2.24;4.96;1.69;0.0861;1.64;1.49;0.676;0.687;8.35;6.99;2.42;29.3;0.411;589.0;0.379;1400.0;0.141;-50.7;-1.42;1540.0;0.182;1150.0;0.227;-59.2;-1.12;2590.0;0.155;916.0;0.372;-66.0;-0.957;-17.8;-0.356;30.4;0.273;-0.0148;-1.95;-0.0189;-0.59;1.2;0.695;32.1;0.306;13.7;0.601;5.01;1.97;5.07;1.73;-9.7;19.9;-0.0272;-0.0105;0.625;1.96;0.923;0.4;0.502;0.0702;0.0617;-20.0;0

She had to do the cleaning of theirplace and it was to be a party.A ball; a party; a certain night and she wanted to go. And she couldn't go. The stepmother wouldn't let her go.She had to stay back and do the cleaning; continued to do the cleaning.She really wanted to go. She's doing the cleaning and she imagined that if she did go it would somehow catch her.I don't remember that scene.And she's still doing the cleaning and went to it.And then she gets delivered an invitation to go. But it doesn't apply to her; the wicked stepmother.I don't know if stepmothers are wicked. Anyway; this one was. So she reads the invitation and she goes with thetwo daughters. But Cinderella isn't allowed to go or look at the invitation.But Cinderella makes herself a gown for the ball. She sews it. She's a good seamstress.And it fits. It looks nice on her. And the place is so far away. The castle is so far away.She wonders how to get there. And these animals help her. Give her suggestions. I think there's three of them.And she follows the stepmother and the two daughters to the ball; to the party.And she doesn't go. And they're sad for her.Then comes the fairy godmother and tells her; you can go.But you have to be home by midnight or you'll turn into a pumpkin. So go have a good time. And you'll go in this chariot.And you'll have a good time there. You'll be doing dancing. But remember to come home by that certain time. So she goes to the ball.Enteres the place. And the king is there with the prince.She dances with the prince. They have a good time. And then she looks at the clock that she's going to be late. So she comes running down the stairs.And on the way down; drops one of her slippers. And races home. With the chariot. And the; well I think there's four horses; right? It's even number.So she realizes that she gets back. She's missing one of the slippers. So she comes home.And meets the stepmother.And then one of the advisors of the royal court comes to see who it would fit. The slipper. The slipper would fit that was left on the steps.And checks everybody. It doesn't fit the others. But it fits her. Cinderella. And they get married.She marries the prince. Or he marries her. Whichever way. And they live happily ever after. And the other animals. There's four of them? I thought it was three. Four of them.They're very happy on her behalf.

25;Baycrest6819a_plain.txt;"Well; I'll start with yesterday. Great. Because that's as far as my memory goes back. Yesterday; I went back to the bargaining group where I worked for 15 years.I retired from them last August; and they brought in a part-time person; and I had to help her with the year-end process.And I found out; which was rather interesting; that when I do go back; I'm not keen on going back. I like the retirement stage.So; I went there; and we thought we had our problem solved at about 5.15; and I said; and I all of a sudden realized that we did not; so I'm going to have to go back again next week. Oh; dear.We're faced with a problem as far as time is concerned. We have to get done by a certain time; and it's part of the work I just didn't like doing. Okay. Keep on going?Oh; I'll keep on going for two hours if you want.I get up; I'll actually check emails before I even have breakfast.I will then have my breakfast; and get showered; shaved; and usually go out for a walk.After that; I will spend a lot of time on my computer checking investments; checking emails; Lumosity; et cetera; et cetera. So; I spend a lot of time on my computer. I shouldn't spend as much time as I do.Okay. The boy is kicking a soccer ball.The ball happens to go through the window and actually land on somebody who is sitting in there. The man gets up and looks out the window. Great. Excellent.The boy is going off; probably to school; and he says; I don't want the umbrella; and he waves goodbye to his mother. Then it starts to rain; and it's raining real hard; and he comes back to his mother.She says; do you want the umbrella? And he takes the umbrella. Great. The cat is up in the tree.The father decides to take the umbrella. The father decides to go up and rescue the cat. The ladder falls down; and the firemen finally come to rescue the father.Cinderella was the sister. She had two or three sisters. Her mother was very mean to her.Her mother felt that the other two sisters were much better than Cinderella was; and Cinderella was meant to just clean up in the house.There was going to be a ball; and Cinderella would like to go to the ball. But the mother wasn't interested at all in sending her there.She wanted only the sisters to go; and she dressed them up; and the sisters were ugly and fat.And Cinderella; as the sisters—are they supposed to be attached?Yes. Yes; they are. Okay.As the sisters went off to the ball; Cinderella met—went about her cleaning up jobs.Something was delivered to her. She was able to go to the ball. She got a job.She met a fairy princess; and the fairy princess got her all dressed up and sent her in a pumpkincarriage and with glass slippers; and at midnight; she was dancing with the—oh; the—the condition was that she be home by midnight.And at midnight; she was dancing with the prince; and she heard the clock strike; and she dropped one of her—slippers. She ran down to the pumpkin to get home and nobody knew where she was and theprince found the slipper and he wanted to go through the country to find out who owned this slipper and they went around to all the houses and all the sisters; the lovely stepsisters tried it on the slipper; they couldn't get it and then they tried it on Cinderella and it fit Cinderella. She was bound to be a princess. Great; excellent. It's been along time since I've done Cinderella. For sure.

And then I came here. But normally I would; well; I would go swimming or skiing in the morning.And then I would go; sometimes I have some work that I do. And sometimes I don't. But when I don't have work; I would do my own work.Like I do furniture; furniture inspiration; upholstering; chair caning. So if I have some work; I do that. Then I probably go for a walk. And...And maybe go shopping. And make some phone calls. I'm a late pastor at the Unitarian Congregation; so I have to follow up with some phone calls.Maybe call a friend or two. And then make dinner. And read a book. Watch TV. Read a book. Sometimes do writing. Sounds like a nice full day. Yeah.And this next task; we have some pictures here; and basically these pictures are setup kind of like a comic strip. So what I'd like you to do is look at the pictures and tell me the story that the comic tells.The boy's playing soccer; he kicks the ball through the window; the man's sitting there in the chair; the ball breaks through the window and the man gets the ball; andhe looks; you know; I can't see how he looks; but I assume he's pretty upset.Well; the mother's telling the little boy to take an umbrella to; I assume he's going to school; he has a backpack on; and the little boy doesn't want to take the umbrella; andthe mother seems; well; I don't know; doesn't show that she's that upset. It's raining out; and he gets all wet; and then he comes home to get the umbrella; becausehe realizes he made a mistake. And then he goes home and he gets all wet; and then he comes home to get the umbrella; and the mother turns around and says; I think she should have taken the umbrella. And then he just stops for a minute.Um; well; the cat got up into the tree; the little girl's upset; because it's her cat. The father tries to get the cat; but he seems to be stuck in the tree; the dog is barking;because everyone; everything's in chaos; and a fire truck comes with a ladder to try to get the cat.the father down from the tree.Cinderella was a stepsister. She had four sisters. They weren't very attractiveoverly. And Fairy Godmother came and said Cinderella can go to the ball. And so shegot these beautiful shoes and dress. And she had a coach drawn by a horse and then she went to the ball. But she had toleave the ball by 12 o'clock. And so she just; I think she was; met the prince atthe ball and then she left. But she was late so then she left one slipper and had oneslipper and then she got into the coach. And the coach; the horses turned into pumpkins.And then the prince was going around looking for Cinderella to find the other who fit theslipper and he went to her house and all the fat ugly stepsisters tried it on but it didn'tfit. And finally Cinderella fit and said; oh you've found my true love or something. And all the sisters would meet her. And they were jealous.

27;Baycrest7546a_plain.txt;"Was it important or was it important? Important in what way? Like; monetarily?Well; I guess I went to the garden party in Buckingham Palace. That was neat. Yeah.Yes. Do you want me to tell what happened?Okay. I was working in London; England as a teacher. And in a very small school.And I don't know; but hook or by crook; I got this invitation to go to a Buckingham Palace garden party.With a whole pile of invitations; like; you know; if you drive by car; if you walk; there's passes for all these places to go into. So; it was a big bunch of stuff I got in the mail.And; well; I was super happy; of course. So; I went to my headmaster. And told him that. And he was super happy.And he just immediately told all the teachers; which were only like seven. And everyone except one were happy for me.And the other one just said; yeah; the foreigners get to do those things; but we don't. We're British. I'm the foreigner from Canada; right?So; but anyway; everybody was very happy. So; this guy who was nasty like that; he didn't talk to me for the rest of the year and a half I was there. He just; he was really angry. I don't know.I didn't do anything; right? Yeah. How did you get the invitation? So; I think it was through Canada House. Because when you go to England; for instance; to work or something; you should always register with Canada House.It was at Trafalgar Square; you know. And just; you know; to know that you're there. And if something happens to you; you know; they have a trace on you. Anyway; so that's what happened. So; I went.And it also said; well; if it rains; it's rained out and there is no second chance. So; it was; the garden party was in July. So; of course; thank goodness it didn't rain.And it was very; you know; strict about you had to wear a hat. You had to wear; this was 1963. I mean; hat; gloves; stockings; heels; like proper dress.Didn't matter; you know; if it was cold or warm. I mean; it had to be proper dress. And they were very strict about that. And so; we went there. And; you know; you go through the palace gates.You go through Buckingham Palace itself. You go down the steps. And then there's this huge garden with ponds and flamingos in the ponds. And they had three tents.Like; you know; like a wedding tent you would have. Three. One for the common mob; like me. One for the diplomats. And one for the royal family.So; and then there they were serving iced tea; iced coffee; and little biscuits and; I don't know; little sandwiches; whatever it was. So; and there were little tables set up and everything. Very; very nice.And then there were different bands playing in different places. Because the place is really quite big. I don't know if you've been; but it is quite big. Yeah. And so; at a certain time they said; okay.Now the royal party is coming. So; we all kind of got up. And there are walkways all along the garden there. So; we stood along the walkways.And there comes; you know; the queen; Philip; I don't know. So many other royals. I didn't know who they were at the time. And I didn't really care that much. But it was interesting.And; of course; that was the touch when the queen; the time when the queen never; ever shook hands with anyone. You know; there was no greeting or; you know; how are you.They just kind of walked nonchalantly past us all. Kind of smiling to the right and to the left. And then walked into their tent. Like they were kind of really bored.Because; you know; she does it three times a year. Two in London and one in Scotland. So; and then we went back to having our coffee and our little sandwiches and stuff.And little chit chat with whoever; you know. We happened to chit chat with. And I think by 4 o'clock; 4.30; they told us; you know; you started to leave. That was the end of it.So; but it was a really very nice afternoon. Happened to be fabulous weather. So; that was a big; big bonus. You know; and that was very nice. So; when I got back to school; then they; well; of course; I had to have the afternoon.Actually; the headmaster told me take the whole day off to get ready. You know; instead of just the afternoon. Well; next day I got back to school. And everybody was super happy and curious what happened.Everything except this guy who just didn't like it. So; it was; it was nice. It was a nice; it was a nice afternoon. Something to remember. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Definitely.And the Queen; of course; at that time was; you know; I'm talking now; 63. That's 50; 50 years ago; eh? You know; so she was a young woman.And I was; she was very spiffy. And; of course; he; I mean; she was.speak visa. So that was nice. That's very cool. That's very interesting. Okay; so the second question is; can you describe to me what you do on an average day? So for example; what you did yesterday?Oh; on an average day; well yesterday I had lunch guests from Britain. I have a lot of visitorsbecause I've been abroad so much myself and lived abroad in all kinds of places so I have a lot of outside contacts and; you know; because I go visiting; they come visiting of course.So yesterday I had friends from London who were here at my place for lunch. So in themorning I prepared lunch for them. They came at 12.30. We had lunch and talked about everything including why we're here. William; why Kate wasn't pregnant.They passed the one year mark. Well; exactly. And it's really crucial now; isn't it? So that was; you know; and of course Conrad Black and all. I mean; we talked about everything; you know; under the sun.Yeah; and then they left about five and then my nephew came over and we cleaned the garden. We just kind of cut down everything; you know.It wasn't blooming. So it was a lot of stuff to cut down and because it was such beautiful weather. So we sat in the garden; had a few drinks and until seven o'clock and then it got dark.And we saw a raccoon that came from my garage because the garage door was open. You know; we opened the garage door to get the tools out; the stuff; you know; the rake out.That's more or less my tools; my rake and my spade. Yeah; and then this old fat raccoon comes walking past. Oh; jeez. That was quite funny actually.They're so; they're so quiet and they're so evasive and they're so; you know; like you wonder what the heck was he going; you know? Yeah. Yeah.And they don't make any noise whatsoever. No noise. So that was my day yesterday and after that I washed the dishes; washed poop; washed some TV and that's it.That was it. That was my day. But every day is different. I don't have two days the same. That's good. Yeah. Absolutely.Oh; okay. It looks like the boy is playing in the garden; playing football.And I guess by mistake he kicks the ball and it goes through a window.And it goes through the window and lands through the window in the house and hits the lamp.And beside the lamp there's a guy sitting in his armchair. And the lamp; I think it falls.And it looks like; and the guy gets up and sees the broken window. Okay. Yeah; I don't know what happened to the lamp here. Okay.And what about the next photo? Oh; sorry; the next. The next page. Okay. The next page.So I guess it's time to maybe go to school in the morning. And the mother is giving the umbrella to her child.So the child says; well... Oh. I don't think the child gets the umbrella.Anyway; the third picture is the child; it's starting to rain. And now the kid has no umbrella. So now he's in; now he's getting wet. So he's; fourth picture he's running.Running back home; I guess. So he comes home all wet. The mother is angry. And mother gives; I guess; gives the kid the umbrella.So now the kid is on his way with the umbrella. Okay.And the last one.So what do we have here? Well; it looks like a; there's a tree; a man is in a tree.Or there's a cat on a branch. And I think the little girl wants the cat.And it's probably the... The father then went up the tree to try to rescue the cat.Meanwhile; the dog is barking up the tree; because of course the dogs chase cats.And meanwhile; now they're getting the fireman there; I guess; to come and rescue the cat off from the tree there. Or maybe rescue the father.I don't know. Okay. Great.Okay. Yeah; okay. So there's this girl; Cinderella.She lives in a household with three stepsisters and a nasty stepmother; and they're all nasty.And the invitation comes from the palace for these three girls to go meet the prince or something. And they get all dolled up.And of course; Cinderella has to stay home and do the dirty work. So they get to the... Okay. And they get to the ball. The three girls get to the ball; and everything's fine.Meanwhile; Cinderella is at home and doing hard work. And then the fairy godmother appears and said... Asks her if she wants to go; and yes.And the fairy godmother gives her a kiss. And then the princess goes to the palace. Gives her whatever. A beautiful gown and slippers and everything. And she's off to the ball in a pumpkin.And she says; you've got to be home by 12 o'clock. So she gets to the ball; and the prince is there having a fabulous time.And as it's 12 o'clock; Cinderella runs down the stairs of the palace; and one of her slippers falls off.And meanwhile; the princess; I think; had an eye on her. And she goes to the ball. But anyway; she rushes back to her pumpkin; because otherwise; I don't know what's going to happen. Anyway; she has to go. So she went.And then the prince says; well; you know; I want to find the girl who has this glass slipper. And so; the hunt goes out.So they all go out; and looking for the girl who fits... Whose foot fits the slipper. So they come to the house. And of course; the three sisters are there.They're super excited. They try on; but no; it didn't work. So anyway; then they... Then they say; well; there's Cinderella still there. You know; let her try it on.And then; of course; the slipper fits her. And the prince is happy; and they live happily ever after.
